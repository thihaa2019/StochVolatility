## Why do we want to forecast volatiltiy of the stock market?



- Risk management
- Portfolio Optimization
- To estimate the return volatility of stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles
- Many other financial activities

- [What good is a Volatility model ? ](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/rengle/EnglePattonQF.pdf)

## Investigative Questions

- 1) How will a single variable time series improve our prior beliefs that stocks have 

- 2) Is there significant evidence that the volatility of SP500 stocks increased?

- 3) In 171 days, what will be the forecasted returns of the SP500 stock?

## Prerequisites ( What is SDE and why is it important? )

 


- A stochastic process $(S_t)_{t\geq0}$ is a GBM(Geometric Brownian Motion) if it is the following stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the form:

$$ dS_{t}=\mu S_{t}\,dt+\sigma S_{t}\,dW_{t} $$

- $(W_t)_{t\geq0}$ is a Standard Brownian Motion.

- Black-Scholes, an asset pricing model, follows this model. 
- [Non-trivial introduction to SDE in Finance ](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387401010)

## Interpretation of GBM on Black-Scholes model
$$ dS_{t}=\mu S_{t}\,dt+\sigma S_{t}\,dW_{t} $$

- t = time of the year(in days) 

- $S_t$ = price of the underlying asset at time t 

- $S_0$ = price of the underlying asset at time t=0

- $\mu$ = drift rate (i.e. expected return) of the asset at time t

- $\sigma$ = volatility of the asset

## Problems with Black-Scholes

- Assumes stock prices to follow lognormal distribution at all times
- No considerations of dividend payout
- Assumes constant return rate $\mu$
- ***Assumes constant volatility***

## How do we fix constant volatility of Black Scholes? 

- GARCH (A time series model) introduced by Engle (1982) and Bollerslev 

$$y_t ∼ N (0, σ_t^2) $$
$$ σ_t^2 = α_0 + α_1y_{t−1}^2 + βσ_{t−1}^2 $$ 

- $\sigma_t$ =  Volatility at time t 

- $y_{t-1}$ = log of the return at time t-1. (i.e. ln(\frac{S_t}{S_0}))

- other models to consider: Student's t-distribution and General Error Distribution

## Parameters of GARCH

- Error parameter: α1 is a measurement of how the model reacts to volatility. Larger α1 value implies the more sensitive the model is to large drops/rises. 

- Lag parameter: β is a measurement of how long the volatility is going to be. For example, the larger β value implies it is going to take longer for the current volatility trend to die out. 

- Volatility Persistence parameter: α1+β is a measurement of how fast the current shock to volatility will die away, or the conditional volatility converges to the long-term average.

## Distinguishing dataset
- estimate parameters of models using data from 2020-01-01 to 2020-09-02
- having the majority of the data to estimate parameters of models, we anticipate a rise in the MAE and MASE while making forecasts

## Posterior Distribution
- recall the prior distribution is under GARCH(1,1).  α_0 ~ normal(2.47e-6,0.5);
   α_1 ~ normal(0.1256,0.5); β1 ~ normal(0.8543,0.5)
- data follows Gaussian
- From posterior approximation: α_0 ~ normal(2.092329e-05,8.853679e-06); α_1 ~ normal(3.514761e-01,7.095016e-02); β1 ~ normal(6.134901e-01,7.095822e-02)

- Run one sample t test for each parameter, sample size = 170


## Posterior Analysis 
- the error parameter is estimated at 3.514761e-01 much higher indicating an increased sensitivity to large drops/ rise
- the lag parameter is estimated at 6.134901e-01 slightly higher indicating a longer duration of volatility
- the rate of convergence paramter is 0.9649662
- MAE: subsequently was increased to ..
- MASE: subsequently was increased to..

## Conclusions
- The single variable time series data can use the GARCH model to effectively analyze parameters a0, a1, and b1.
- Using a t test for each of the parameters, there is significant differences at level = 0.05.
- After 170 days, the forecasted SP500 value is ...
